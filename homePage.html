    <a href= "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/food-waste-report-second-harvest-1.4981728">According to CBC last year </a>, 58% of food in Canada is wasted. Not only does this have a lasting environmental impact, but the food thatâ€™s being thrown out is in perfectly good condition and thus could still be consumed.
The Leftovers Club here at UBCO helps to tackle food waste by collecting items that were to be thrown out, broadcasting to those on campus so that it can be eaten.
